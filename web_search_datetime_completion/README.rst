More completion options for datetime fields
===========================================

This module was written to extend the offers shown to the user when starting
to fill in a date. In standard odoo, the only offer is the date at 00:00:00
hours, while it can be convenient for the user to have other options, too.
When searching for the end of a period, ``23:59:59`` would come to mind, and
there also might be domain specific times that make sense.

Installation
------------




Configuration
-------------





If you do nothing, only the time ``23:59:59`` is added to the completion
dropdown.

In your code, you can add an options dictionary with a key
``completion_options`` which contains a list if dictionaries detailing the
offsets that should be added to the parsed date, like::

<field name="my_datetime_field" options="{'completion_options': [{'hours': 12, 'minutes': 30, 'seconds': 0}]}" />

which would offer to search for the date at half past twelve. Note that when
you set ``completion_options``, you have to list all options you want to see,
as the standard options will be replaced with your list.

Usage
-----








=====

Start filling in your date in a search field and choose one of the additional
options offered.
