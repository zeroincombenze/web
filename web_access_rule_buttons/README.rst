Web Access Rules Buttons
========================

This addon disables the Edit button on the form views if the user
cannot edit the current record according to the record access rules.

Configuration

Usage

=====

When using Odoo, even if a user has no rights to edit a record, the Edit button
is shown. The user can edit the record but won't be able to save his changes.
Now, the user won't be able to click on the Edit button.
