Context in colors
=================

This addon allows to use the current context in colors, thereby allowing i.e.
search filters changing the colors used in a tree view. This also works for
the fonts attribute.

Installation
------------


Configuration
-------------


Usage
-----

-----

=====

You might define a search filter::

<filter name="paid_green" string="Show paid invoices in green" context="{'paid_should_be_green': True}" />

And then you could use::

<tree colors="green:state == 'paid' and context.get('paid_should_be_green')">

in your tree view. Take care here that the first match wins, so order your
color expressions accordingly.
