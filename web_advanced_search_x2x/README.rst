Search for x2x records in advanced search
=========================================

Standard behavior in advanced search for one2many, many2many and many2one fields is to do a `name_search`. This often is not satisfactionary as you might want to search for other properties. There might also be cases where you don't exactly know what you're searching for, then a list of possible options is necessary too. This module enables you to have a full search view to select the record in question, and either select specific records or select them using a search query of its own.

Installation
------------





Configuration
-------------





Usage
-----







=====

To use this module, you need to:

* open the advanced search options in a search view
* select a one2many, many2many or many2one field
* select operator `is equal to` or `is not equal to`
* the textfield changes to a many2one selection field where you can search for the record in question
* click *Apply*

To search for properties of linked records (ie invoices for customers with a credit limit higher than X):

* open the advanced search options in a search view
* select a one2many, many2many or many2one field
* select operator `is in selection`
* in the search view that pops up, select the criteria
* select the records you want, or select the top corner box to select all matching records with that criteria
* click *Select*

Note that you can stack searching for properties: Simply add another advanced search in the selection search window. You can do this indefinetely, so it is possible to search for moves belonging to a journal which has a user who is member of a certain group etc.

Known issues / Roadmap
----------------------






* When you use *is in selection* search system and choose a domain, it gets
  immediately applied, so to add a new condition, you will have to use again
  the *Filters* menu.
