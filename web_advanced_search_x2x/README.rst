Search for x2x records in advanced search
=========================================

Standard behavior in advanced search for one2many, many2many and many2one fields is to do a `name_search`. This often is not satisfactionary as you might want to search for other properties. There might also be cases where you don't exactly know what you're searching for, then a list of possible options is necessary too. This module enables you to have a full search view to select the record in question, and either select specific records or select them using a search query of its own.

Installation

Configuration

Usage
-----







=====

To use this module, you need to:

* open the advanced search options in a search view
* select a one2many, many2many or many2one field
* select operator `is equal to` or `is not equal to`
* the textfield changes to a many2one selection field where you can search for the record in question

To search for properties of linked records (ie invoices for customers with a credit limit higher than X):

* open the advanced search options in a search view
* select a one2many, many2many or many2one field
* select operator `is in selection`
* in the search view that pops up, select the criteria
* click `Use criteria`
* if you're only interested in certain records, mark them en click `Select`
* if you want to change your selection afterwards, click the search symbol right of the selection term

In both cases, don't forget to click `Apply` to actually execute the search.

Note that you can stack searching for properties: Simply add another advanced search in the selection search window. You can do this indefinetely, so it is possible to search for moves belonging to a journal which has a user who is member of a certain group etc.
