Dashboard Tiles
===============

Adds a dashboard where you can configure tiles from any view and add them as short cut.

By default, the tile displays items count of a given model restricted to a given domain.

Optionally, the tile can display the result of a function on a field.

- Function is one of `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max` or `median`.
- Field must be integer or float.

Tile can be:

- Displayed only for a user.
- Global for all users.
- Restricted to some groups.

*Note: The tile will be hidden if the current user doesn't have access to the given model.*

Usage

=====

* Dashboad sample, displaying Sale Orders to invoice:

.. image:: ./static/src/img/screenshot_dashboard.png

* Tree view displayed when user click on the tile:

.. image:: ./static/src/img/screenshot_action_click.png

Known issues
* Can not edit tile from dashboard (color, sequence, function, ...).
* Original context is ignored.
* Original domain and filter are not restored.
* To preserve a relative date domain, you have to manually edit the tile's domain from `Configuration > User Interface > Dashboard Tile`. You can use the same variables available in filters (`uid`, `context_today()`, `current_date`, `time`, `datetime`, `relativedelta`).

Roadmap
* Add icons.
* Support client side action (like inbox).
* Restore original Domain + Filter when an action is set.
* Posibility to hide the tile based on a field expression.
* Posibility to set the background color based on a field expression.
