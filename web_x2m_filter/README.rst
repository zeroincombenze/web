Usage

=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. add a key ``web_x2m_filter`` to the field's ``options`` dictionary
#. this key should contain a list if dictionaries which describe a button by the properties ``name`` and ``domain``::
   
        {'web_x2m_filter': [{'name': 'Only admins', 'domain': [('groups_id', '=', %(base.group_erp_manager)s)]}]}
#. to have one filter being active on form load, add a key named ``default`` with value ``True``
#. the string in ``name`` is subject to the standard translation mechanism
#. the domain is evaluated with the user's context and the current form values
